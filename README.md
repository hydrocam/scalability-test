# Serverless Scalability Testing for Image Segmentation Pipeline

This repository contains code, logs, and analysis related to the scalability testing of a serverless, event-driven image segmentation pipeline using AWS Lambda and Amazon S3. The goal is to evaluate how the pipeline performs under increasing workloads â€” simulating up to 300 monitoring sites operating concurrently.

## What This Tests

- Cold start latency and total execution time across 1â€“300 concurrent Lambda invocations
- Image segmentation reliability under scale using containerized, site-specific models
- Log-based performance metrics extraction using CloudWatch
- Scalability trends, bottlenecks, and throughput analysis

---

## Analysis Highlights

Located in `scalability_analysis/`:

- `scalability_data.csv`: Collected runtime and performance metrics for each site
- `data_retrieval.ipynb`: Scripted extraction of logs from AWS
- `data_plotting.ipynb`: Visualizations of execution time, memory use, concurrency scaling, etc.

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- AWS CLI with credentials configured
- Docker installed and running
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter installed (e.g., via Anaconda or `pip install notebook`)
- Required Python libraries:
  - `boto3`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `seaborn`
  - `numpy`

## ðŸ§ª How to Run the Tests

1. **Build and push Docker images to ECR**  
   ```bash
   cd deployment
   ./build_and_push.sh
